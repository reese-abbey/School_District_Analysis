# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to conduct a school district analysis using Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a software that allows you to create documents that contain live code using Python. Using Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library, I've read raw data from a given CSV file, inspected and cleaned data, merged datasets, performed mathematical calculations, and created visualizations of the data with charts and graphs to analyze data. I was given two data sets: one CSV containing the needed school data and another containing cleaned data representing the students from said schools. We analyzed data from all schools given (Charter & District) including school size, budgets, and reading/math scores.  Specifically, we are looking at the data for Thomas High School as it was found that there was evidence of altered data. I cleaned the data to find the true test scores and percentages to reflect accurately what Thomas High School's scores were.
