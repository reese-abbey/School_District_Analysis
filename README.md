# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to conduct a school district analysis using Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a software that allows you to create documents that contain live code using Python. Using Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library, I've read raw data from a given CSV file, inspected and cleaned data, merged datasets, performed mathematical calculations, and created visualizations of the data with charts and graphs to analyze data. I was given two data sets: one CSV containing the needed school data and another containing cleaned data representing the students from said schools. We analyzed data from all schools given (Charter & District) including school size, budgets, and reading/math scores.  Specifically, we are looking at the data for Thomas High School as it was found that there was evidence of altered data. I cleaned the data to find the true test scores and percentages to reflect accurately what Thomas High School's scores were.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data

- How is the district summary affected?
-- The district summary is hardly effected. 
- How is the Thomas school summary affected?
-- The specific school there is more of a noticable change in the new calculation. 
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
-- blah blah blah
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
-- blah blah blah
- Math and reading scores by grade
-- blah blah blah
- Scores by school spending
-- blah blah blah
- Scores by school size
-- blah blah blah
- Scores by school type
-- blah blah blah

#Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
